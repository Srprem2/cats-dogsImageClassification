Image Classification Models: CNN vs. KNN
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The CNN model utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for image classification of cats and dogs. The architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, and dense layers. Training for 10 epochs achieved an accuracy of approximately 91.44% on the validation set.

CNN Model Summary:

Total Parameters: 14,848,193
Trainable Parameters: 14,847,745
Non-trainable Parameters: 448
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The KNN model, implemented using scikit-learn, relies on flattened grayscale images for classification. The dataset is preprocessed, and KNN with k=5 is trained. The accuracy on the test set is approximately 78.75%.

Comparison:

CNN outperforms KNN with a significantly higher accuracy (91.44% vs. 78.75%).
CNN captures hierarchical features through convolutional layers, making it more effective for image classification tasks.
KNN relies on pixel values, treating each image as a point in a high-dimensional space, which might not capture intricate patterns as effectively as CNN.
